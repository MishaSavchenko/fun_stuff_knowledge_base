## Ingredients  
* [ ] 300 g smoked tofu, drained and pressed  
* [ ] 40 g nutritional yeast  
* [ ] 0.5 tsp garlic powder (optional)  
* [ ] 0.5 tsp onion powder
* [ ] 0.5 tsp smoked paprika  
* [ ] Golden breadcrumbs
* [ ] Sesame seeds  
### Spicy Dip
* [x] ~5 tbps Greek style (vegan) yogurt  
* [ ] ~ 1 tsp Sriracha
* [ ] 0.5 Lemon juice  
## Instructions  
1.  Add tofu and nutritional yeast to a food processor and blend until you get a thick paste. Depending on how much water you drained from the tofu it’ll be softer or harder, but it’ll work either way.
2. Scoop out the dough (or if it’s firm enough roll it in your hands to shape a ball) and palace it on a plate covered with the breadcrumbs. 
3. Roll the tofu until it’s evenly covered and has the shape of a ball.  
4. Place it in the pre-heated air fryer, spray with oil 
5. Air fry for 20 minutes at 356F/180C or until it’s crusty and golden outside  
6. For the spicy dip just mix yogurt, sriracha, and juice of half a lemon until well combined
