 > Im still not sure about exactly the plan for Valkyrie is. Upgrading her to ROS2 and trying to get as many things working on other robots as possible is a generally good idea but how will it serve the broader team and organization's goals? There
 > So let's assume that March 2025 rolls around and  we have Valkyrie fully upgrade to ROS2; IHMC still sits in the middle and given the results we are currently seeing with the MoveIt and Directional Control and all the other stuff it would probably having the same issues as we are currently having
 > 	What ARE the issues exactly?
 > 		* Localization
 > 		* F/T sensor drift
 > 		* Degraded performance after a period of time
 > 		* Lack of access into IHMC software
 > 			* Lack of precision/accuracy of commanding the robot.
 
* 04/23/2025
	* Major fuck-ups this week, *reflection, and introspection*.
		1. On Tuesday (04/21/2025) I over-promised for an untested product.
			* I did not plan what to introduce in the meeting and went in too haphazardly. The result is that I **announced** to everyone that the port was over.
			* Of course there were a bunch of issues that yet to be resolved across the entire stack.
			* I have gave away help at the same time as failing to prepare for next week.
			* Having a clear agenda for the meeting would have been more beneficial. Management is another part of my role that I have to take more seriously. Plan for people's work, hold them accountable. **You can't do everything by yourself**
		2. Zombie issues are coming up
			* incomplete list of tasks, issues, and objectives have creeped up on me
			* several issues that were hidden away, revealed themselves at the last possible minute
			* Better documentation, and planning can help me prevent this from occurring again.
		3. Mistakes will happen, but reflecting to everyone is not going to help you, your standing, or compassion you earn 
		from others.
		4. Impatience
			* some of the previous problems have their own causes by the root of my issues is impatience. Im too eager to finish with Valkyrie because of the construct of what it will be like post project that i have built for myself
			* taking it easier, and slower let focus on what a continuous process for Valkyrie maintenance looks like while satisfying my internal goals
